## Approach & Efficiency
1-append takes new values as it new link list with new issue
2-insert before taking new values as it new linked list with new node
3-methods to insert a new node in linked list are discussed. ... to a node, and the new node is inserted after the given node

This is extending an impementation problem, we take input k, which is a number repesents the place starting from tail of the linked list, and returns the value of the node at that place.

# Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.
For this challenge we have to merge two linked lists together to get one linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
The challenge was to merge two linked lists like a zipper athache selotion
