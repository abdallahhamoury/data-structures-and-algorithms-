## Approach & Efficiency
1-append takes new values as it new link list with new issue
2-insert before taking new values as it new linked list with new node
3- methods to insert a new node in linked list are discussed. ... to a node, and the new node is inserted after the given node

# code 7

# Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.
This is extending an impementation problem, we take input k, which is a number repesents the place starting from tail of the linked list, and returns the value of the node at that place.
